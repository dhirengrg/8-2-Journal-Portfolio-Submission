•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The purpose of this project to create web-based online class and practice test for new driving students based on client’s wants so it helps to improve the students to score more and pass the test. The client is Liam who has the company called DriverPass and they need the system to be able to access through online, reserve new students, and perform online class and practice test.
•	What did you do particularly well?
I did well in part of creating UML Activity Diagram and Sequence Diagram.
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the Gantt Chart and Class Diagram to improve it. I would improve it making more precisely and adding more clear information of task.
•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
User’s needs in the system are to access the online DriverPass system to practice and needs to log-in with the valid credentials. User also needs to get the information from the DMV’s policies and rules for the test. User needs to make schedule for their class as well.
•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
For the future designing, I would use the collections of information from the clients and implement it into the diagram to understand the clear view of the design and analyze and design.
